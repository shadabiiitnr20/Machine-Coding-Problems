### List virtualization

- Render elements only that are visible in the window/view-port

### Approach

- First approach should be server side pagination.
- But if we have to do it from client side then we can use a npm package.

### Things to consider while using a npm package -

- Maintenance and Updates (Check open issues and PRs)
- Bundle Size
- Project Compatibility (SSR etc.)
- Developer Experience/ Ease of use (Easy documentation/APIs)
- License Review (MIT etc)
- Security (Open Issues/PRs)
- Project Specific Parameters
